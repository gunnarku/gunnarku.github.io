# Compiler warnings

* From "[Broken Warnings Theory](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/broken-warnings-theory/)": "In our Diagnostics Improvements Survey, 15% of 270 respondents indicated they build their code with /Wall /WX indicating they have a zero tolerance for any warnings."
* From NASA's "[Cyclomatic Complexity and Basis Path Testing Study](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205011566)": "Ensure that all code compiles without warnings, with warnings enabled at the highest possible level (e.g., gcc–Wall–pedantic) and map warnings to errors (i.e., compiler warnings stop the build)." and "Requiring that all code be compiled with all available warnings in the compiler enabled at their highest level (e.g., -pedantic), while generating zero warnings."
