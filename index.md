# Gunnar Kudrjavets

Most of my career I have been a knuckle dragger software engineer
who likes to design, write and optimize low-level code (which in this day
and age is defined as `C` or `C++`).
My favorite shell is a debugger prompt.
Microsoft taught me how to be an operating systems engineer who knows
a thing or two about systems performance and security.
Facebook enabled me to refine those skills in a different context.
Public description of my career evolution is at my
[LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunnarku/).
