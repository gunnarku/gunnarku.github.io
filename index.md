# Gunnar Kudrjavets

## The Real World
I have been a software engineer who has liked to design, write, and optimize low-level code (currently defined as `C` or `C++`) for most of my career.
My favorite shell is a debugger prompt.
My favorite theater of operations is the unpleasantness of reality.

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) taught me how to be an operating systems engineer who knows a thing or two about systems performance and security.
[Meta](https://www.meta.com/) (company formely known as Facebook) enabled me to refine those skills in a different context.

A public description of my career evolution is on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunnarku/).

My academic ties were associated with the [University of Groningen](https://search-rug.github.io/) (Netherlands), but physically I still live in the Seattle area, Washington, USA.

## Research
I defended my dissertation on October 17, 2023.
My thesis supervisors were [Dr. Ayushi Rastogi](https://ayushirastogi.github.io/) and [Prof. Paris Avgeriou](https://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/) from the [Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/) at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) in Netherlands.
I was part of the [Software Engineering and Architecture research group](https://search-rug.github.io/).
A preprint of every recent research paper I have written and accepted by arXiv is available [there](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Kudrjavets,+G) for free.

My research projects focus on empirical challenges coming from the existing large-scale software projects in industry.
The key qualifier for me is the practical application of results.
Any study I am involved with must be eventually useful for software engineers.
