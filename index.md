# Gunnar Kudrjavets

## The Real World
I have been a software engineer who has liked to design, write, and
optimize low-level code (currently defined as `C` or `C++`) for most
of my career. My favorite shell is a debugger prompt.

Microsoft taught me how to be an operating systems engineer who knows
a thing or two about systems performance and security.
Facebook enabled me to refine those skills in a different context.

A public description of my career evolution is on my
[LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunnarku/).

## Research
My research projects focus on empirical challenges coming from
the existing large-scale software projects in industry.
The key qualifier for me is the practical application of results.
Any study I am involved with must be eventually useful for software engineers.
