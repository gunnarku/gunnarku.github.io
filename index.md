# Gunnar Kudrjavets

I completed [my dissertation](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/the-need-for-speed-increasing-the-code-review-velocity) in March of 2023.
My formal thesis defense will take place on **Tuesday, October 17, 2023, at 16:15 in Aula**.
The ceremony will take place in **Groningen, Netherlands**.

Academia does not operate under the "Move fast and break things" culture ;-)

## The Real World
I have been a software engineer who has liked to design, write, and optimize low-level code (currently defined as `C` or `C++`) for most of my career.
My favorite shell is a debugger prompt.
My favorite theater of operations is the unpleasantness of reality.

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) taught me how to be an operating systems engineer who knows a thing or two about systems performance and security.
[Meta](https://www.meta.com/) (company formely known as Facebook) enabled me to refine those skills in a different context.

A public description of my career evolution is on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunnarku/).

My academic ties are associated with the [University of Groningen](https://search-rug.github.io/) (Netherlands), but physically I still live in the Seattle area, Washington, USA.

## Research
My research projects focus on empirical challenges coming from the existing large-scale software projects in industry.
The key qualifier for me is the practical application of results.
Any study I am involved with must be eventually useful for software engineers.

[Resources](resources.md) I find helpful in pretending to be a semi-functioning Ph.D. candidate.
