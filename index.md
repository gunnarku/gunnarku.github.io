## The Real World
For the most of my career I have been a knuckle dragger software engineer
who likes to design, write and optimize low-level code (which in this day
and age is defined as `C` or `C++`).
My favorite shell is a debugger prompt.

Microsoft taught me how to be an operating systems engineer who knows
a thing or two about systems performance and security.
Facebook enabled me to refine those skills in a different context.

Public description of my career evolution is at my
[LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunnarku/).

## Research
 My research projects are focused on empirical challenges coming from
 existing large-scale industry projects. The key qualifier for me
 is that the results from any study I am involved with must be useful
 for software engineers.
