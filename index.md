# Gunnar Kudrjavets

## The Real World

For most of my career, I have been a software engineer who has liked to design, write, and optimize low-level code (currently defined as `C` or `C++`).
My preferred shell is a debugger prompt.
My favorite theater of operations is the unpleasantness of reality.

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) taught me how to be an operating systems engineer who knows a thing or two about systems performance and security.
[Meta](https://www.meta.com/) (a company formerly known as Facebook) enabled me to refine those skills in a different context.
Ironically, I now work on various things related to Linux (kernel) internals.

As of March 2024, I am a Principal Engineer at Amazon ([AWS EC2 Nitro](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/) team).
It feels good to be back and act as a "[man who is actually in the arena](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7-it-is-not-the-critic-who-counts-not-the-man)" and not just a random poser who talks about software engineering.
You can read more about the Nitro System [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system.html) or look at publicly available [resources](nitro.md).

Physically, I live in Seattle suburbia (Washington, USA).

## Research

My academic ties were associated with the [University of Groningen](https://search-rug.github.io/) (Netherlands).
I defended my dissertation on October 17, 2023.
Majority of my research was related to the insanity of [code reviews](cr.md).
My dissertation received the [MSR 2024 Distinguished Doctoral Research Award](https://2024.msrconf.org/track/msr-2024-msr-awards).
The speed of code reviews matters! ;-)

My thesis supervisors were [Dr. Ayushi Rastogi](https://ayushirastogi.github.io/) and [Prof. Paris Avgeriou](https://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/) from the [Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/) at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) in Netherlands.
I was part of the [Software Engineering and Architecture research group](https://search-rug.github.io/).
A preprint of every recent research paper I have written and accepted by arXiv is available [there](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Kudrjavets,+G) for free.

[Resources](resources.md) I found helpful in pretending to be a semi-functioning Ph.D. candidate.

My research projects focus on empirical challenges coming from the existing large-scale software projects in industry.
The key qualifier for me is the practical application of results.
Any study I am involved with must be eventually useful for software engineers.

- Niklaus Wirth's "[A Plea for Lean Software](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/Articles/LeanSoftware.pdf)" is still one of my favorite CS papers.
- Read "[Producing wrong data without doing anything obviously wrong!](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1508244.1508275)" and ponder about how complicated it is to produce valid results.
- Read "[Thoughts on applicability](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2024.112086)" to understand why there is such a disconnect between academics and practitioners.
